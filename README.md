For MacOS terminal.  Homebrew is required.  Also use iTerm instead of the built in terminal.

brew install romkatv/powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k

echo "source $(brew --prefix)/opt/powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k.zsh-theme" >>~/.zshrc

p10k configure

brew install zsh-autosuggestions

brew install zsh-history-substring-search

brew install zsh-syntax-highlighting

add to bottom .zshrc file

source /usr/local/share/zsh-autosuggestions/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh

source /usr/local/share/zsh-history-substring-search/zsh-history-substring-search.zsh

source /usr/local/share/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh

restart terminal

If you receive "highlighters directory not found" error message,
you may need to add the following to your .zshenv:

  export ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_HIGHLIGHTERS_DIR=/usr/local/share/zsh-syntax-highlighting/highlighters
